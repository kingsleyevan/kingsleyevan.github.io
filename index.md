<h1 class="text-center">Evan P Kingsley, PhD</h1>

<p class="lead text-justify">
I am a biologist studying the developmental genetic basis of evolutionary adaptation. I am currently a postdoc in the lab of [Cliff Tabin](https://tabin.hms.harvard.edu/), combining genomics and classical embryological techniques to study the evolutionary and developmental origin of the syrinx, the avian voicebox.
I received my PhD in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard in the lab of [Hopi Hoekstra](https://hoekstra.oeb.harvard.edu/), where I worked on the evolution of tail length variation in deer mice. 
Before that, I worked on early cleavage in snail embryos as a technician in [Dave Lambert's](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bio/people/faculty/lambert_david/) lab at the University of Rochester.</p>
